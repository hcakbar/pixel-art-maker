# Pixel Art Maker
A single-page web application that lets users draw a pixel image on a customizable panel.

Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript build a web application that lets the user create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece!

Users should be able to:

1. Dynamically set the size of the table as an N by M grid. 
2. Choose a color. 
3. Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.
